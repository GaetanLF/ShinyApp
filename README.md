# ShinyApp
### Developed by : Mehdi FERHAT, Gaëtan LE FLOCH, Alexis VIGNARD (2020)

We have made this straightforward Shiny app in order to analyse data from three distinct problematics given by our instructor within the framework of our studies at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne university.

### How to make it works ?

Just download all the repository and launch 'app.R' on your R Terminal, it will be sufficient.
